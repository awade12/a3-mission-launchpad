**Launchpad** is a robust suite of tools to aid Arma 3 mission makers and eventually modders. Launchpad features project organization/resource tracking, scripting, and soft-profiling - both in-game and out. There's a lot of tooling out there for mod makers; this project focuses on **mission makers**, at least to begin with. The main purpose of Launchpad is to fill the gap that Arma 3 Tools and 3DEN lack in terms of workflow quality, project visibility, and day-to-day mission iteration speed.
